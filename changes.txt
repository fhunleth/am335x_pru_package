This summary describes the changes to the user interface that have been made
since the last release of this software (in July 2013).
Documentation needs to be modified to reflect these changes:

Added:
  prussdrv_extmem_size()
  prussdrv_version()
  prussdrv_strversion(int version)
  prussdrv_get_event_to_channel_map(unsigned int event)
  prussdrv_lookup_event_to_channel_map(const intc_data*, unsigned int event)
  prussdrv_get_channel_to_host_map(unsigned int channel)
  prussdrv_lookup_channel_to_host_map(const intc_data*, unsigned int channel)
  prussdrv_get_event_to_host_map(unsigned int event)
  prussdrv_lookup_event_to_host_map(const intc_data*, unsigned int event)

  prussdrv_pru_wait_event(unsigned int event) (not the same as the old version)
  prussdrv_pru_event_status(unsigned int event)
  prussdrv_pru_reset_event(unsigned int event)
  prussdrv_pru_reset_interrupt(unsigned int host_interrupt)
  prussdrv_pru_interrupt_fd(unsigned int host_interrupt)
  prussdrv_exec_code(int prunum, const unsigned int *code, int codelen)

  prucode.hp library for very basic set of useful macros for PASM code
  python ctypes wrapper around prussdrv library
  "install" added to Makefile(s)
  old_examples--not sure we should take on documenting this yet.

Changed:
  prussdrv_pru_wait_event(unsigned int host_interrupt) (original version)
    split to
    prussdrv_pru_wait_interrupt(unsigned int host_interrupt)
      --only waits for interrupt
        now returns the number of times the interrupt has occurred
    prussdrv_pru_reset_interrupt(unsigned int host_interrupt)
      --only resets the interrupt.  Needs to be done _after_ service _and after_
        triggering event is cleared
  prussdrv_pru_send_wait_clear_event(send_event,host_interrupt,ack_event)
    changed to
    prussdrv_pru_send_wait_reset_event(send_event,ack_event)

  prusdrv_exec_program(int, char*)
    should be changed to (int, const char*)
    returns -1 upon failure

  Several parameters that are used as readonly were marked as const

  pasm:
    --#include <> has changed meaning now...Now follows convention to search for
      file within set of include dirs
    --add -I<directory> command line option to add files to the set of
      directories searched for resolving #include <...> directives
    --add support for c-style comments (/*...*/)
    --add support for line continuation using the '\' character

  examples:
    --updated to reflect redefined constants
    --updated to use prucode.hp library macros

  events/channels/hosts:
    --see below--

Removed:
  prussdrv_start_irqthread
  pthreads dependency

Fixed:
  build on FreeBSD
